            <h2><strong>Edvard Munch's Life</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1863 - 1880: AFFECTED</strong> - Edvard Munch is born on 12 December 1863, the son of
                    Christian Munch, a military doctor, and his wife Laura. He spends his childhood in Kristiania,
                    today’s Oslo, where the family lives on his father’s meagre doctor’s salary. When Munch is five
                    years old, his mother dies from tuberculosis. The Munch children soon find a substitute mother in
                    their aunt, Karen, who moves in with them and takes over the household.

                    <p>As a child, Edvard is sick and close to death more than once. Having to stay in bed for whole
                        winters, he is unable to attend school and is taught at home instead. But his poor health also
                        gives him the freedom to pursue his passion – drawing. Young Edvard draws everything:
                        landscapes, rooms, portraits, still lifes, fictional motifs and works by other artists.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1880 - 1885: SEARCHING</strong> - Munch’s youth is shaped by the religious rigour and
                    emotional instability of his father, but also by the creative home environment. Aunt Karen
                    encourages his artistic endeavours, and in 1880, he enrols at the Royal School of Art and Design in
                    Kristiania, where he gets to draw from live models. Finally he feels as if his talent awakens.
                    <p> Painting outside, Munch captures the industrial sites along the Akerselva River, strolling
                        citizens on the boulevard Karl Johan and farmers on their way home.</p>

                    <p>He rents a studio space in the city centre with six friends. Here he meets his first mentor and
                        supporter, the renowned artist Christian Krohg, who encourages him to find his own way.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 22, thanks to a scholarship, Munch finally travels to Paris where he stays for
                        three weeks. For the first time, a bigger world beyond Norway opens up to him.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1885 - 1889: AWOKEN</strong> - In 1885 Munch has his first love affair. In the coastal town
                    of Åsgårdstrand, where he often spends his summers, he meets Milly Thaulow who is four years older
                    and married. Their secret relationship fills him with lust and love, but also shame and ambivalence.
                    He writes about his affair with Milly, encouraged by the call of his friends, the so-called
                    Kristiania Bohemians. Led by Hans Jæger, the group advocates free love and radical self-expression.

                    <p>The following year, Munch participates in the annual Artists’ Autumn Exhibition with a painting
                        he later calls The Sick Child. This image of a young girl dying from tuberculosis draws on his
                        experience of losing his sister Sophie when he was just 14 years old. The motif is not unusual
                        for Munch’s time, but what provokes people is the way it is executed – rough, hasty, sore,
                        unfinished. The painting is both praised and fiercely criticized. It represents a small
                        breakthrough.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1889 - 1892: RAMMET</strong> - In the spring of 1889, Munch rents a space in Kristiania and
                    fills it with his own paintings. It is the very first solo exhibition in the city, a bold move which
                    helps him secure a scholarship for a one-year stay in Paris. Before boarding the steamboat, he and
                    his father say goodbye. It is the last time they will ever speak.

                    <p>During his first months in Paris Munch takes drawing lessons, visits art galleries and socializes
                        with fellow expats at the Café de la Régence, but he soon runs out of money. In November, his
                        father suffers a stroke and dies. Munch is devastated. He moves to the suburb of Saint-Cloud,
                        where he revels in memories of loss in his cold and damp apartment. But he also emerges from
                        this crisis with new artistic ideas. He wants his art to be personal and profound, stripped down
                        to the existential states of the human soul.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1892 - 1896: INFLAMED</strong> - In 1892 Munch is invited to exhibit his pictures at the
                    Association of Berlin Artists. Munch’s art polarizes opinion among the members of the Association
                    and shocks the German public. After only one week the show is shut down. ‘I could not have a better
                    form of publicity’, Munch writes to Aunt Karen.

                    <p>In Berlin he makes new friends, among them the Swedish writer and artist August Strindberg, the
                        Polish author Stanisław Przybyszewski and the music student, Dagny Juel. They gather at a wine
                        tavern which Strindberg names ‘The Black Piglet’. They gather at a wine tavern which Strindberg
                        names ‘The Black Piglet’. It is a place of excess, freedom and intellectual sparks, with
                        energetic discussions about life and art, accompanied by heavy drinking. </p>

                    <p>In this period Munch creates some of his most famous motifs, including The Scream (pastel
                        version), Vampire, Puberty and Madonna.</p>

                    <p>He takes up printmaking, which gives him great freedom to experiment, but also allows him to
                        reproduce his artworks in greater quantities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1896 - 1902: RESTLESS</strong> - In 1896 Munch makes an attempt to conquer the Paris art
                    world. He fails. His pictures do not find the same resonance they did in Berlin.

                    <p>In 1898 Munch meets Mathilde Larsen, called Tulla, and they become a couple and travel together.
                        But Munch is overcome by the same ambivalence that characterizes all his relationships with
                        women. For him, art is more important than anything else. In 1902, their relationship ends in a
                        quarrel, and a gunshot is fired from a pistol Munch keeps in his house. He hurts his hand. It is
                        an incident that will continue to haunt him. He embarks on a creative quest to reinvent himself
                        as an artist. His images from the 1890s, in which he explores inner feelings and personal
                        experiences, suddenly seem outdated. As Europe wakes up to a modern world full of new
                        technologies, mass media, high-speed transportation and urban living, Munch searches for forms
                        to express this new world.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1902 - 1916: REBORN</strong> - In 1902 Edvard Munch presents a group of images representing
                    all the aspects of human existence. He calls it The Frieze of Life. The same year in Berlin, he
                    meets the violinist Eva Mudocci, and they become lovers and friends. His career picks up again, but
                    at the same time, his physical and mental health deteriorates. He travels restlessly, drinks to
                    excess and remains in a constant state of nervousness. In 1908, on the brink of exhaustion, he asks
                    to be committed to Dr Daniel Jacobson’s private clinic in Copenhagen, where he stays for several
                    months.

                    <p>For the first time in years, he is completely abstinent. He rents a house in Kragerø, a small
                        fishing town in Southern Norway, and returns to his homeland for good. Between 1909 and 1916, he
                        works on the decoration of the University of Oslo’s assembly hall. The paintings he produces on
                        gigantic canvases are full of life and energy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1916 - 1944: COMPOSED</strong> - In 1916, Munch – by now a famous artist – purchases the
                    former plant nursery Ekely on the outskirts of Oslo. He moves into its Swiss-style villa and
                    constructs several studio spaces. He paints and draws the horses in their fields, the elm forest,
                    the fruit trees and the garden, capturing his surroundings in dynamic and colourful brushstrokes.

                    <p>In 1940 German troops invade Norway and take control of the country. Munch becomes anxious about
                        his artworks. He changes his will and bequeaths nearly all of his works to the municipality of
                        Oslo.</p>

                    <p>On 19 December 1943, one week after Edvard Munch’s 80th birthday, a gigantic explosion shakes
                        Oslo. Awoken by the blast, Edvard Munch stumbles the winter darkness and later captures the
                        event in a watercolour. The next day he is sick with a cold.</p>

                    <p>He never fully recovers, and dies peacefully in his sleep on the 23rd of January 1944.</p>
